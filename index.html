      <h2> Journal Entry #1 </h2>
      <p>Today I tutored, did a lot of school work, and watched some TV.</p>
      <h2> Journal Entry #2 </h2>
      <p>It is a quite busy day today! I have an assignment due for CSE 101. I can't wait for the weekend!</p>
      <h2> Journal Entry #3 </h2>
      <p>This weekend was great. The sun was finally out after a cloudy week and I was able to go to the beach for a bit. I mostly did school work though! It was still nice, however.</p>
